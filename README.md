# About

The <a href ="https://www.raspberrypi.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Raspberry%20Pi-A22846?style=flat&logo=raspberry-pi&logoColor=ffffff"></a> is a powerful and affordable single-board computer that can run a full Linux system, making it feasible for scientific computing, machine learning, and other programming tasks, including some entry-level research projects.

I am planning to recreate some of the toy models and small projects I worked on during my undergraduate studies on the Raspberry Pi, which may be useful for teaching purposes in the future.
